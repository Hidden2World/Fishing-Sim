~Naming Convention for Asset Names~

---

General:

-Upper camel case
-Underscores between sections
-General name before specific (so ButtonRed instead of RedButton)

---

Sections and Order:

NameOrUseOfAsset_SceneTheAssetIsUsedIn_ModifierOrStatus

---

Examples:

BackgroundTundra_EndCard_Temp
ButtonStart_TitleScreen_Final

---

Explaination:

-General terms first so that all like-objects are sorted together (so all buttons are together and easy to find)
-Addition of the used scene in order to make searching for the asset you are looking for while working in a specific sceen easier (will become more important once we start getting a bunch of scenes)
-Modifier/Status like 'Temp' for temporary for easy search when replacing assets and updating assignments (could be a tag but I am the type who will forget to add tags and just name an object and zoom off to work so I wet for it in the name instead. Can be changed upon request)
